# e-trials_throttle
Development of a microcontroller to go between the throttle and main motor controller on an e-trials bike.

The micro manages throttle smoothing and provides a 'virtual flywheel' effect by applying torque to force the motor to follow a pre-determined RPM decay rate when the throttle is closed.
